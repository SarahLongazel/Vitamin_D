By Sarah Longazel

The home page offers information on nutrients and how 
vitamin D from sunlight is absorbed into the skin. The quiz
link has a single question for the user to answer.

###CSS
Both the home page and the quiz page are designed 
with flexbox.  

###Javascript
-The hamburger menu reveals the navigation for the site
when clicked

-The quiz features a drag and drop with an alert
informing the user if the question was answered correctly

###Media Queries
Both media queries change how the user will read the 
information needed to pass the quiz based on the
width of the user's device.

# Vitamin_D
By Sarah Longazel

The home page offers information on nutrients and how 
vitamin D from sunlight is absorbed into the skin. The quiz
link has a single question for the user to answer. This project was 
tested with Mozilla Firefox, Chrome, and Android.

###CSS
Both the home page and the quiz page are designed 
with flexbox.  

###Javascript
-The hamburger menu reveals the navigation for the site
when clicked

-The quiz features a drag and drop with an alert
informing the user if the question was answered correctly

###Media Queries
Both media queries change the layout of the homepage based 
on the width of the user's device. Information on this 
page is needed to pass the quiz.   

@Media for largest screen aligns flex items for no scrolling.
@Media for tablet sizes keeps things aligned in a column 
and moves the how-works article to the top.
